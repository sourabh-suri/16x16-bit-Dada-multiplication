The process of Dadda multiplication is as follows:The
entire 32 x 32 multiplication requires eight stages. Always the
first stage is partial product stage, which is obtained by simple
multiplication of multiplicand with multiplier. The proposed
32-bit multiplier requires eight reduction stages with
intermediate matrix heights of 28, 19, 13, 9, 6, 4, 3 and
finally2.
In Dadda implementation, in general, the numberof full
adders required is N2
-4N+3 and the number of half adders is
always N-1.
